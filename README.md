# DataCamp_Website_Design
A DataCamp challenge about website design and the use of AB testing for conversion rates

This was a simple challenge in the DataCamp challenge section where I created an AB Test to determine the best website design change.

Please feel free to comment to message me with any changes I should do.

Thanks,

Michael.
